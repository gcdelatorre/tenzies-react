## 👨‍💻 About This Project
I made this project as part of my React learning journey.  
I'm still in **my second week of learning React**, and this was a fun way to practice hooks, props, and state management.  
Building this helped me understand how React components interact and how to manage dynamic UI updates. 🚀
